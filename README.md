# CryptXchange

CryptXchange is a cryptocurrency exchange web application based on blockchain technology, specifically the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to send cryptocurrencies from one wallet to another securely and efficiently. The project utilizes smart contracts written in Solidity and leverages the Hardhat framework for configuration and deployment. The Sepolia testnet is used for testing and experimentation purposes.

## Features

- Secure and efficient cryptocurrency transfers
- Utilizes Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts
- Frontend developed using React.js
- Smart contract development using Solidity
- Transaction history for the latest transfers

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/CryptXchange.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

## Smart Contracts

The project includes smart contracts written in Solidity, located in the `contracts` directory. These contracts define the cryptocurrency transfer logic and are compiled and deployed using the Hardhat framework.

## Deployment

The smart contracts are deployed to the Sepolia testnet using the Hardhat framework. The deployment script can be found in the `scripts` directory.
